## 1. Introduction

### What is Immutable Passport?

![Immutable Passport](https://github.com/VivekNakrani/Immutable-Passport-Integration/assets/97658605/a2bdea4a-eb79-4f0b-9ff5-6bc5bda598ac)

Immutable Passport is a cutting-edge blockchain-based authentication system tailored for gaming applications. It delivers robust security, efficient user data management, and the capability to oversee blockchain assets. Game developers can seamlessly integrate this system into their applications by registering with the Immutable Developer Hub.

### About This Guide

Welcome to the realm of blockchain-based authentication and elevated security! This comprehensive guide is your gateway to integrating Immutable Passport into your application. Immutable Passport is a revolutionary solution crafted specifically for gaming applications, enhancing both security and functionalityâ€”a crucial component for an exceptional gaming experience.

Are you ready to harness the capabilities of Immutable Passport and embark on a journey into the world of blockchain gaming? ðŸš€ Let's get started!

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin with Immutable Passport integration, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Code Editor:** A code editor is essential for making changes to your application. We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

- **Node.js and npm:** Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them yet, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

- **Next.js Application:** You should have a Next.js application ready for integration, or the ability to create one from scratch.

- **Immutable Developer Hub Account:** To interact with Immutable Passport, you need an account on the Immutable Developer Hub. You can sign up for an account [here](https://developers.immutable.com/).

- **JavaScript and Node.js Knowledge:** A basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js is recommended to navigate the integration process effectively.

By ensuring these prerequisites, you'll be well-prepared to seamlessly integrate Immutable Passport into your application.

## 3. Immutable Passport Integration Steps

### i. Creating Your Application

First, you need a basic Next.js application. You have two options: create one from scratch or clone a pre-built repository.

#### Create a New Application

- Create a new project directory.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Initialize a new Node.js project to generate a package.json file.
- Install Next.js and React.
- Create a "pages" directory to host your application pages.
- Create a basic Next.js page in the "pages" directory.
- Update your package.json to include a "dev" script.
- Start your Next.js application.

#### Clone an Existing Application

- Clone a repository with a pre-built Next.js application.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Install project dependencies.
- Start the application.

Make sure your application is set up and running before moving on.

### ii. Registering Your Application

To integrate Immutable Passport, you need to register your application on the Immutable Developer Hub. Here's how:

- Sign in to Immutable Developer Hub or create an account if you don't have one.
- Register a new application, specifying the application type, name, and configuration details.
- Obtain client credentials, including the Client ID.
- Add the Client ID to your application's environment variables.

By registering your application, you've taken the first step toward Immutable Passport integration.

### iii. Installing and Initializing the Passport Client

In your application, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and initialize the Passport Client to interact with Immutable Passport.

- Install required dependencies.
- Initialize the Passport Client with the obtained Client ID and configure other settings.

With this step, your application is ready to connect with Immutable Passport securely.

### iv. Logging in a User with Passport

To log in a user, you'll need to initiate the authentication process. Use the following code as a guide:

```
// Define a function to initiate user authentication
const loginWithPassport = async () => {
  // Request user account access through Passport provider.
  try {
    // If successful, the user is connected.
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle authentication errors.
  }
};

// Call the login function when needed to trigger the authentication process.
```

With this code, you can effectively handle user authentication in your application.

### v. Displaying User Information

After authenticating a user, you can access and display their information, including the ID token and access token. Use this code to fetch and display user data:

```

// Define a function to fetch and display user information
const displayUserInfo = async () => {
  // Fetch the user's profile information and tokens.
  try {
    // Display user information in your application.
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors when fetching user information.
  }
};

// Call the function when needed to display user information.
```

By following these steps, you can effectively fetch and display user information post-authentication.

### vi. Logging Out a User

To log out a user from your application, use the following code:

```
// Define a function to log out a user.
const logoutUser = () => {
  // Trigger the Passport logout process.
};

// Call the function when the user initiates the logout process.
```

With this code, you can implement user logout functionality effectively.

### vii. Initiating a Transaction from Passport

To initiate a transaction using Passport, provide the necessary transaction data and parameters. Use the code snippet below as a guide:
```
// Define a function to initiate a transaction.
const initiatePassportTransaction = async (transactionData) => {
  // Use the 'initiateTransaction' function to send the transaction data.
  try {
    // Handle the transaction response, e.g., display the transaction hash.
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors when initiating the transaction.
  }
};

// Call the function with the required transaction data when initiating a transaction.
const transactionData = {
  // Define the transaction data and parameters here.
};

// Call the function to initiate the transaction.
```
By following these steps, you'll be able to initiate transactions from Passport in your application. Ensure you populate the transactionData object with the appropriate values for your use case.
